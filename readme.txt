In this toy project, I will format the front-end to act like twitter using http://getbootstrap.com/ and jquery

Implement the following tasks:

1) Modify index.html with symantic markup for tweets with ids and classes 
2) Append new tweets on "Show more tweets" button
3) timestamp stays up-to-date
4) Add boostrap, and create the basic grid layout
5) Add styles.css to layout  tweets, buttons, heading/footer, background, nav

Extras features I'd like to do:

1) Create a tweet submit box using the function twitSubmit(message) which accepts an object with properties of "logged in" user and message
2) "Show more tweets" button will show the running count of new tweets.
3) Make a "Now Viewing" box
	a.	Add ability to view individual user feeds when clicking on username
	b.	Back to homepage from individual user feed "view entire feed"
	c.	No “show more tweets” button in the individual view

Things to think about:
GitHub Account gets updated.
Stop page from jumping to top on button or link refresh.
